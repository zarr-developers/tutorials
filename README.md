# Zarr Interactive Tutorial

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Zarr tutorial! This tutorial was created for the 2022 [Cloud-Native Geo Event](https://schedule.cloudnativegeo.org/). It borrows heavily from the [tutorial section of the Zarr docs](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html).

_Level: intermediate python programs. Ideally you are already a bit familiar with Numpy and Xarray._

This will be a live-coding tutorial. You will get the most out of the tutorial if you follow along in a blank notebook and type the code in yourself. 

**Learing Goals**

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to 

- Identify the fundamental data structures in Zarr (Groups and Arrays) and the key properties of Arrays (shape, dtype, chunks, attributes)
- Create Arrays and Groups in local files or in S3
- Create and edit attributes (metadata)
- Read and write data into Arrays
- Evaluate the tradeoffs of different Array chunking strageies
- Read and write NetCDF-style data to Zarr using Xarray
- Do parallel processing on Xarray / Zarr data using Dask
